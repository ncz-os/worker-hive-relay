"""Home-side reconciler: terminal/ -> open -> land patch -> hive status + purge.

Polls the relay bucket's single ``terminal/`` prefix, decrypts each sealed
object with the shared E2EE key, branches on its ``status`` (done/failed/
needs-review), LANDS any needs-review patch as a ``hive/node-<jobid>`` review
branch on the canonical repository (a patch that exists only inside a job
result is an orphan), reports the job's terminal status back to the hive, then
purges the job's objects. Decoupled from the remote node; runs whenever.
